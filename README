PostScript::ScheduleGrid version 0.03, released May 11, 2013


This module creates a printable schedule of events (using PostScript)
in a grid format often used for TV listings.  You supply the schedule
data.  If you're producing actual TV listings, the
PostScript::ScheduleGrid::XMLTV module (distributed separately) can be
used to get the schedule data from XMLTV.
