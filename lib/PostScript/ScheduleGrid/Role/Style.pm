=head1 NAME

PostScript::ScheduleGrid::Role::Style - Something that customizes a cell's appearance

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.01 of
PostScript::ScheduleGrid::Role::Style, released December 7, 2013
as part of PostScript-ScheduleGrid version 0.04.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role describes a style for displaying the contents of a cell in
the grid.  The class must provide a C<define_style> method.

If a style has PostScript definitions that are invariant, it may
define them by adding a function block under its class name (with
C<::> replaced by C<_>).  If it needs more than one function block, it
may append a hyphen and an arbitrary identifier.

The definitions must begin with the class name (with
C<PostScript::ScheduleGrid::Style::> replaced by C<s> and any
remaining C<::> replaced by C<_>.  That prefix may be followed by a
hypen and any legal PostScript identifier.  For example,
C<PostScript::ScheduleGrid::Style::Stripe> can define PostScript
identifiers beginning with C<sStripe->.

The C<name> function created by the C<define_style> method will be
called with no parameters.  The clipping path is set to the boundaries
of the cell, and the current font is the grid's C<cell_font>.  The
graphics state has been saved and will be restored after the cell's
text is drawn.

The function must perform whatever drawing it wants to, and leave the
color and font set for the cell's text.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

This is the name of the PostScript function that the Style must
define.  It may also use any identifiers beginning with C<name>
followed by a hyphen for any purposes it likes.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 _ps_eval

  $style->_ps_eval(\$string, ...);

This method is provided by this role.  It substitutes values from the
object into each C<$string> (which is modified in-place).  Any number
of string references may be passed.

The following substitutions are performed on each C<$string>:

First, any C<$> followed by an identifier are replaced by calling that
method on the object and passing its return value to
PostScript::File's C<str> function.

Second, any C<%{...}> is replaced with the result of evaluating ... (which
may not contain braces).


=head2 define_style

  $style->define_style($schedule_grid);

This method must return a string containg PostScript code to define
the function specified by C<name>.  C<$schedule_grid> is the
PostScript::ScheduleGrid object using the style.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

PostScript::ScheduleGrid::Role::Style requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
